This is the software for Techie Pizza's FIRST LEGO League project, **SIDEWALK DETECTION: E-SCOOTERS AND PEDESTRIANS CAN COEXIST**.

Data for a variety of sidewalks and streets can be found in sidewalk/good, street/good.  There is also data for users standing with the scooter in standing/good.

Our neural network model is in training.py .

Our coaches provided us with bmx.py which is software to talk to a bmx055 accelerometer, and beep.py which can play sounds on a piezo speaker.

gather\_accel.py is a program that records accelerometer data.
